# Hacker Hub 🧰

A personal collection of weird, fun, and practical projects I’ve been building – from apps and extensions to experiments and tools that went viral (and some that didn’t).

This isn’t a course. It’s not a tutorial series.  

It’s just a shelf full of **real builds** – the kind I personally love making, and maybe you will too.

> If you enjoyed anything I made, consider fueling my tiny coffee fund :)

## 🧠 What’s Inside

- Weird and fun complete projects
- Full source code with walkthroughs
- Experiments: Face-controlled games, meme bots, AI auto-likers
- Tools: Browser extensions, full-stack apps, automations, CV toys
- Code comments + writeups to help you understand the "why" and "how"

Some of these projects:
- Got featured on HackerNews, Reddit, LinkedIn
- Went viral (2M+ views)
- Taught me far more than courses ever did

## 💸 A Fee

I’ve always open-sourced a lot, and I’ll continue doing that.  

But putting this together – organizing the code, cleaning it up, writing guides, fixing edge cases – takes time and effort.

So this small fee helps:
- Support the time I put into making this useful for others
- Motivate me to keep adding new projects regularly
- Filter in people who genuinely want to explore and learn

If you’ve ever found joy in weird internet builds, or want to learn by actually building stuff – I think you’ll like this.

## 🎁 Pricing

- **$10** – Lifetime access to everything
- **$99** – Lifetime access + DM support for debugging and deep dives

No subscriptions. No upsells. Just a one-time thing.

If money’s tight but you’re genuinely curious, DM me and we’ll figure something out.

## 🙌 Who this is for

- Developers who love tinkering
- Builders who learn best by doing
- Anyone tired of overly polished “Hello World” tutorials

No fluff. Just stuff that works.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What am I getting access to?**  
A: A curated shelf of my projects I’ve built — full source code, notes, and context.

**Q: Is this a course?**  
A: No. It’s not a course or tutorial — just real projects with clean code to learn from.

**Q: Is it beginner-friendly?**  
A: If you've built a few basic things before, you'll be able to follow along.

**Q: How often is it updated?**  
A: I build something new almost every week — you’ll get lifetime access to all future additions.

This shelf is for the rest – the messy, fun, and deeper stuff.

Thanks for checking this out.  
If you end up building something inspired by this, I’d love to see it! 🙌
